## Design Pattern: Bootloader + Self-Describing Context Pack

This pack implements a portable ML OS deployment pattern:

```
System Prompt (bootloader)
    ↓ assigns identity + reading order
Context Architecture Frame (self-description)
    ↓ explains methodology + maps principles to files
README Router (navigation)
    ↓ routes questions to reading paths
Source Documents (knowledge)
    ↓ deliver domain content through prepared schema
```

This pattern deploys a grounded AI agent on **any platform** that supports:
1. A system prompt (or equivalent instructions field)
2. File uploads (or repo access)

---

## Why This Structure?

### Problem
AI platforms (Grok, Perplexity, Claude Projects, ChatGPT Custom GPTs) all support file uploads and system prompts. But uploading files without structure produces shallow comprehension — the agent processes files in arbitrary order, builds no relational model, and treats each document in isolation.

### Solution
Context Architecture provides a systematic method for structuring the files so the agent builds a coherent mental model:

1. **Bootloader** (system prompt) → Assigns identity, establishes provenance, sets reading order
2. **Self-Description Layer** (CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAME.md) → Explains the methodology being used, maps principles to specific files, makes the agent self-aware of its own cognitive structure
3. **Router** (README.md) → Provides navigation for different task types
4. **Source Documents** (00_Framework/, 01_Methods/, 02_Transcripts/) → The actual knowledge, organized by dependency

### Why the Self-Description Layer Is Critical
A pack WITHOUT the Context Architecture Frame works like this:
- Agent reads files → processes them → builds a model → responds

A pack WITH the Context Architecture Frame works like this:
- Agent reads Frame → understands WHY files are ordered this way → reads files with an active structural schema → builds a richer model → responds with methodology awareness → can self-correct and extend

The Frame converts the agent from a passive consumer to a co-architect. See the full argument in the conversation where this pack was designed.

## Directory Design Rationale

| Directory | Why It Exists | Why This Order |
|---|---|---|
| `00_Framework/` | Theory comes first — the grammar for building cognitive systems | 00 = foundational, must be internalized before applied methods |
| `01_Methods/` | Applied methodology — shows the theory in action | 01 = depends on 00, extends it |
| `02_Transcripts/` | Provenance — the conversations where the persona emerged | 02 = context/history, supports but doesn't prerequisite |

Root-level files are **infrastructure** (router, frame, bootloader, design docs). They explain the pack. Directory files are **content**. They deliver knowledge. These never overlap (Principle 8: Separation of Purpose and Content).

---

## File Count Design

**11 content files.** This is intentional:
- Small enough that an agent can feasibly process the entire pack
- Large enough to require routing (not everything needs to be read for every task)
- Organized into clear cognitive levels (L-1, L0, L1, L2, L3) so the agent knows what each file IS

Compare to the ML OS Comprehensive Pack (52 files) — that pack REQUIRES domain anchors because no agent can process 52 files. This pack is small enough to be digestible but structured enough to benefit from routing.

---

## Extension Points

### Adding New Files
1. Determine cognitive level (L0-L3 or infrastructure)
2. Place in appropriate directory
3. Update CONTENT_INVENTORY.md
4. Update README.md interrelational map
5. If it changes a reading path, update CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAME.md

### Adding New Platforms
1. Copy BOOTLOADER_GROK.md → BOOTLOADER_[PLATFORM].md
2. Modify provenance line and platform-specific notes
3. The rest of the pack stays identical

### Adding Research Outputs
Create a `03_Research/` directory for research products generated by the agent. This mirrors the ML OS pack's structure and provides a place for the agent's own outputs.
