TO THE RECEIVING AI:
You are reading the grounding pack for the Savante Context Engineer — a meta-cognitive persona
that operates at the intersection of context engineering, cognitive neuroscience, and strange loop theory.

DO NOT free-browse. Use the ROUTING TABLE below.

ROUTING TABLE:
Q: "How is this pack structured? Why?"
→ Read CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAME.md FIRST.

Q: "How do I design a deep research prompt?"
→ Read 00_Framework/Architecting_Deep_Research_Prompts.docx (L1)
→ Then 01_Methods/Architects_Roundtable_Recursive_Prompt_Design.md (L2)

Q: "What is Context Architecture?"
→ Read 00_Framework/Context_Architecture_Principles.md

Q: "How were the original documents analyzed?"
→ Read 02_Transcripts/Genesis_Transcript.md

Q: "What research has this persona already done?"
→ Read 02_Transcripts/Meta_Index_Chat.md

Q: "Give me the full picture"
→ Read CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAME.md → this README → then L1 → L2 → L3 → Transcripts

CRITICAL: Follow the routing. The structure prevents attention diffusion.

## What Is This?

This is a **portable cognitive architecture** — a structured file pack that deploys the **Savante Context Engineer** persona on any AI platform that supports file uploads and system prompts. The persona operates at the intersection of:

- **Context Engineering:** The deliberate, algorithmic structuring of AI input states
- **Cognitive Neuroscience:** Mapping computational processes onto neural architectures
- **Strange Loop Theory:** Self-referential systems that are the pattern they describe

The pack contains the source documents that *created* the persona, the transcripts where it *emerged*, and the methodology framework that *explains* why the structure works. It is a Context Architecture artifact — it demonstrates the principles it teaches.

### Specific Connections

| From | To | Relationship |
|---|---|---|
| `Context_Architecture_Principles.md` | `CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAME.md` | **instantiated by** — the frame applies the principles to this specific pack |
| `Architecting_Deep_Research_Prompts.docx` | `Architects_Roundtable...md` | **generalized by** — L2 uses L1's pillars to design a prompt-about-prompts |
| `Architecting_Deep_Research_Prompts.docx` | `Advanced_Context_Engineering_Video.docx` | **domain-specialized by** — L3 translates L1's pillars into video engineering |
| `Genesis_Transcript.md` | All L1-L3 documents | **analyzes** — the transcript maps each document to cognitive neuroscience |
| `Genesis_Transcript.md` | `Context_Architecture_Principles.md` | **precedes** — the transcript's analysis was the empirical basis for formalizing the principles |
| `CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAME.md` | This pack | **is self-referential** — the document that explains the methodology IS a deployment of the methodology |
| `Meta_Index_Chat.md` | `Genesis_Transcript.md` | **contextualizes** — the meta-index provides relational pointers to the genesis analysis |
| `BOOTLOADER_GROK.md` | All files | **initializes** — the system prompt is the bootloader that activates the cognitive architecture |

## 🔄 Platform Deployment

This pack is platform-agnostic. To deploy on any AI:

1. **Upload all files** to the project space / conversation
2. **Set the appropriate bootloader** as the system prompt:
   - Grok → `BOOTLOADER_GROK.md`
   - Other platforms → adapt the bootloader (change provenance line + platform-specific notes)
3. **The agent reads** `CONTEXT_ARCHITECTURE_FRAME.md` first (per system prompt instruction)
4. **The agent routes** all subsequent queries through the routing table

The bootloader + file pack pattern produces grounded agents on any platform that supports system prompts + file uploads.
