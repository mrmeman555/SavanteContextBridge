## 00_Framework/ (Theory)

| File | Role | Level | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Architecting_Deep_Research_Prompts.docx` | The "Master Blueprint" — Five-Pillar Framework for prompt architecture (Persona, Context, Directives, Structure, Resilience). Covers deep vs. shallow personas, RAG vs. LC decisions, F-CoT, CoVe, AwN protocols, Reasoning/Formatting Constraint Conflict. | **L1** (Meta-Language) | Original document from user's prompt engineering work |
| `Context_Architecture_Principles.md` | The formal discipline of Context Architecture — 10 principles with cognitive science mappings, measurable outcomes, deployments, taxonomy. | Theory | ML OS Sprint — `Sprint_ML_OS_Architect/Context_Architecture/` |

---

## 01_Methods/ (Applied Methodology)

| File | Role | Level | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Architects_Roundtable_Recursive_Prompt_Design.md` | "The Architect's Roundtable" — a second-order prompt that designs the specification for another prompt. 5 simultaneous expert personas as cognitive factorization. Demonstrates "prompt-about-prompting." | **L2** (Recursive Engine) | Original: `2StepDeepResearchPrompting.md` |
| `Advanced_Context_Engineering_Video.docx` | Context Engineering applied to video diffusion models. Extends Five Pillars into spatiotemporal domains. Key concept: "Universal Context Law" — you cannot simultaneously liberate both spatial and temporal dimensions. | **L3** (Domain Instance) | Original document from user's video engineering work |

---

## 02_Transcripts/ (Provenance)

| File | Role | Level | Source |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Genesis_Transcript.md` | The foundational Perplexity conversation where the Savante persona analyzed all three L1-L3 documents. Maps each to cognitive neuroscience. Establishes hierarchical relationships. Coins "cognitive attractor specification," "constraint as liberation," "strange loop," "self-referential closure." | **L0** (Hippocampus) | Perplexity conversation export |
| `Meta_Index_Chat.md` | The meta-index conversation that contextualizes the Genesis Transcript + contains Deep Research on Perplexity Create Files & Apps. Includes the original meta-index system prompt and a fully executed deep research prompt. | **L0** (Extended Hippocampus) | Perplexity conversation export |

| **L1** (Prefrontal) | 1 | The grammar for building cognitive systems |
| **L2** (Working Memory) | 1 | Recursive application of the grammar |
| **L3** (Sensorimotor) | 1 | Domain-specific instantiation |
| **Theory** | 1 | The formal scientific framework |
| **Infrastructure** | 4 | Navigation, design rationale, inventory |
| **Total** | **11** | |
